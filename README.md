Project, or process, inspired by GitHub Streak and Album-A-Day

# Background 

## Album-A-Day 

I once tried a project called [Album-A-Day](http://crapart.spacebar.org/aad/). The point of that is to create a music album in one day. There are some rules, in short: 

- You have 24 hours to compose, arrange, record etc. The album is ready when you finish 
- The length of the album or the amount of tracks on it is predefined: I chose 30 minutes or 10 tracks 
- Quantity over quality, the point is productivity: just do it 
- Again: the quality should not be assessed 
- If you get an idea and start working on it, you must finish it before going to the next one 

Album-A-Day was an exhausting project and it was difficult to let go and to cut out the ever-continual assessment and self-criticism. The point for me was to remove all hindrances of not getting stuff done. I am not saying there should be no self-criticism but in this project I tried to ban it as an experiment. Story short, I finished the project and the result was something good and something bad (of course I was allowed assess it afterwards, not immediately, and pick the good things from it which was maybe 5% of the material). It was a good experiment. 

## GitHub Streak 

I know some programming already but I want to make learning it a habit. Habits tend to stick and learning by habit is claimed to be effective. I stumbled across [GitHub Streak](https://zapier.com/engineering/github-streak-habit/), in which the point is to maintain a streak in GitHub commits. That encourages me to do something related to this process everyday. I call it a process since a project has an ending and a process does not. Actually maintaining the streak – you know, if I really have something else to do one day – is not important, but aiming for it is. I would see it somewhat destructive having to force it too much. Especially if something turns out to be time-consuming and difficult, I’m not really into making it a hasty commit. I choose not to consider the streak number as an important thing because it’s not. What I’m doing is important. So here GitHub Streak differs from Album-A-Day to me. Also, an important part of learning is writing and that’s why I’m also documenting the process here. So, I choose to trust my self-discipline and I approach this in a flexible manner. Let’s see how it goes.
