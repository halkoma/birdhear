# birdhear
Search a bird name, choose the type of vocalization (song, call, alarm call,
flight etc.) and listen a random audio clip accordingly.
[xeno-canto](https://www.xeno-canto.org/explore/api) provides an API which can
be used for this.

# TODO

Write the program first in Python and then figure out how to turn that into an
Android app. I want to learn how to Python -> Android app. Paying attention to
creating an effortless user experience.

## The program

Ask the user for input:

- TODO 1. Bird name
    - Would be cool to have a database of the names stored and give suggestions
      â€“ typing on phone is not fun 
    - Maybe get the info regarding the bird at this point while user is
      selecting the next one?
- TODO 2. Vocalization
- (3. User experience: maybe no need to have a "listen" button but play
  automatically instead)
